# Bayesian Conjugacy Visualization Tool README

## Overview

Welcome to the Bayesian Conjugacy Visualization Tool, a specialized Python toolkit for exploring and visualizing Bayesian conjugacies in statistics. This tool is designed to provide interactive visualizations of various conjugate priors and their corresponding posterior distributions, aiding in the understanding of Bayesian inference. It supports the visualization of following conjugacy pairs:

1. Beta-Binomial Conjugacy
2. Gaussian-Gaussian Conjugacy
3. Gamma-Poisson Conjugacy
4. Beta-Negative Binomial Conjugacy

With interactive widgets, users can adjust parameters and observe real-time changes in the prior, likelihood, and posterior distributions, enhancing their grasp of Bayesian conjugacies.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy ipywidgets IPython
```
