# Visualization Tool README

## Overview

Welcome to the visualization toolkit for Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) and Probability Mass Functions (PMFs). This toolkit provides you with four distinct visualization programs:

1. `continuous_pdf_2d_visualization`: A 2D visualizer for continuous probability distributions.
2. `continuous_pdf_3d_visualization`: A 3D visualizer for continuous probability distributions.
3. `discrete_pmf_2d_visualization`: A 2D visualizer for discrete probability mass functions.
4. `discrete_pmf_3d_visualization`: A 3D visualizer for discrete probability mass functions.

With this tool, you can gain better insights into the behavior and characteristics of various probability distributions.

## Prerequisites

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib ipywidgets scipy IPython
```

## Supported Distributions

#### For `continuous_pdf_2d_visualization` and `continuous_pdf_3d_visualization`:

- Gaussian
- Cauchy
- Gamma
- Exponential
- Chi-Square
- Beta

#### For `discrete_pmf_2d_visualization`:

- Binomial
- Negative Binomial
- Hypergeometric
- Poisson

#### For `discrete_pmf_3d_visualization`:

- Trinomial
- Bivariate Gaussian

## Usage

Navigate to the folder containing the desired program. Run the program, and you will be prompted to select a distribution from the list of supported distributions. After selection, follow the on-screen instructions to generate visualizations.
